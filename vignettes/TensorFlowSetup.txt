Installing Tensorflow: (For Macintosh)


#1 you will need the basic dependancies of TensorFlow i.e. numpy, I installed Anaconda to get these installed:

#2 You may need to install matplotlib, Anaconda should have it, but I had some trouble running some of the examples

#3 Install tensorflow:
I found the pip install to work best with anaconda

The Tensorflow setup install stuff is here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation

You may need to re-install Setup Tools to the most recent stable release...
To Get Setup Tools:
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python

#4 to run some of the examples, you will need jupyter notebook.  I installed it using anaconda.
To install jupyter:
conda install jupyter

To start it up:
jupyter notebook
