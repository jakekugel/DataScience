#2 You may need to install matplotlib, Anaconda should have it, but I had some trouble running some of the examples

#3 Install tensorflow:
I found the pip install to work best with anaconda

#4 to run some of the examples, you will need jupyter notebook.  I installed it using anaconda: conda install jupyter

To start the sandbox, do:
jupyter notebook
